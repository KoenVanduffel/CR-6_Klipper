For convenience precompiled klipper firmware is provided.

The BTT CR6 firmware is what I am running and have confirmed to work.

The stock Creality firmware I have confirmed to be able to connect to my old 4.5.2 board but is not confirmed on the 4.5.3 or ERA boards. Also i have not run the 4.5.2 board with Klipper so can't definitely confirm complete working. Please also report your mileage.
